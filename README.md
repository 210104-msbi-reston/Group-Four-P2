# Washington D.C. Hotel Travel Agency

## Project Description

This project is meant to replicate the data of a hotel booking agency working out of Washington, D.C. They store customers, hotels, and associated booking dates and payment info. The data is stored in a normalized SQL Server database, extracted, transformed, and loaded into a denormalized data warehouse using SQL Server Integration Services. It is then converted into an OLAP Cube and stored with SQL Server Analytics Services. The cube is used as a data source to generate elegant reports using SQL Server Reporting Services.
